Script by: Jorge Silva-Jetter (jorge.silva@thejsj.com)

This script generates a series of TSV files with data from the CIA factbook raw data. At the end, it generates a TSV with the correlations between all different measurments, as to see the relatiosnhip between different statistical measurements. For example, does GDP per capita show a similar behavior to population growth? 

Ok, lets face it. No one is going to use this script except me....
Properly documenting it is, at the moment, a waste of time..

Typical usage:'

calcPearson.py --everything - Generete all data in TSV form
calcPearson.py --remove     - Remove all data TSVs in data directory
